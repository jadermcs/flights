# Flights Visualization
It can be visualized in the following link: [Flights Visualization](https://jader.ml/flights)

## Abstract
    In this visualization I present the impact of flights cancellation caused by the terrorist
    attack of september-11 in 2001. In this attack, terrorists kidnapped and used planes, going
    to New York, to crash it against a famous building, World Trade Center, killing thousands of
    civilians. In september there was a huge increase in cancellations as government measures,
    to mitigate/investigate future attacks, and part by curtomers fears about future attacks.

## Design
    I want to point out the huge cancelling to flights that happened in september caused by
    the terrorist attack, part by government actions, part customers fears. An important
    information is to show the total flights, as some months could be more flights than others,
    like period o vacations, etc. Than I notice an interesting thing, flights also decreased a
    little too, so it reinforced the need of this info in the plot. In the beggining
    I intended to plot total flights and cancellations in the same scale but as the cancelling
    ratio is too low compared to all flights it difficulted to see the real impact of the attack
    to I put it in another axis. I chose to use a more flashy color for cancellations to point out
    the main takeaway, also a different plot style, points, to break the scale context.
    The default color for dimplesjs, the api used, is borring, so I did some research and picked
    interesting colors in colorhunt, adding a more appealling aesthetics to the graph. Then I
    applied the IBM font as it looks more "journalistic", then some minor adjustments to sizes and
    spacements.
    I fixed chronology axis as it was ordering by lexigraphical order.
